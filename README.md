[![Open In Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/phaneo/Hands-on-ML/blob/main/README.md)

Notebooks with codes, notes taken and exercises from the book Hands-on ML with Scikit-Learn, Keras &amp; Tensorflow by Aurélien Géron

Will be uploading all the notebooks as I work on them, while going through the book.
Notes taken on key pointers & exercises will also be included.
